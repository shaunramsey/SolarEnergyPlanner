# SolarEnergyPlanner
SolarEnergyPlanner - part of an Android solution to the NASA Space Apps Challenge in 2017. The challenge was called: You are my sunshine. This is half of our submission and the Android application! This is our Solar Energy Planner in Explorer Mode. Find out how much energy your location might produce with a solar panel array. Then, find out how much energy you can actually use throughout the day by trying out a few appliances for awhile!

You can see the consumer side of our application for iOS here: [Consumer Application](https://github.com/NASADreamTeam/YouAreMySunshine)
